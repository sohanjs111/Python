# Week 3

This is a Crash Course on Python. By Google, under Google IT Automation with Python

I had an opportunity to learn python for the second time with deeper and better understanding.

I would like to share with all :)

# What's for this Week?
In this module we explored the intricacies of loops in Python! Learnt how to use while loops to continuously execute code, as well as how to identify infinite loop errors and how to fix them. We also learnt to use for loops to iterate over data, and how to use the range() function with for loops. We also explored common errors when using for loops and how to fix them.
