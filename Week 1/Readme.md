# WEEK 1: 

This is a Crash Course on Python. 
By Google, under Google IT Automation with Python 

I had an opportunity to learn python for the second time with deeper and better understanding. 

I would like to share with all :)

Some useful links I went through during the course are given below:

Have Fun!
