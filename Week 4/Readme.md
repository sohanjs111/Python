# Week 4

This is a Crash Course on Python. By Google, under Google IT Automation with Python

I had an opportunity to learn python for the second time with deeper and better understanding.

I would like to share with all :)

# What's for this Week? 

In this module we will dive into more advanced ways to manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and advanced formatting. We will also explore the more advanced data types: lists, tuples, and dictionaries. We will learn to store, reference, and manipulate data in these structures, as well as combine them to store complex data structures.
