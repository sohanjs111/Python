# Comparison Operators

In Python, we can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison is made, Python returns a boolean result, or simply a True or False. 

To check if two values are the same, we can use the equality operator: == 
To check if two values are not the same, we can use the not equals operator: != 
We can also check if values are greater than or lesser than each other using > and <. If you try to compare data types that aren’t compatible, like checking if a string is greater than an integer, Python will throw a TypeError. 

We can make very complex comparisons by joining statements together using logical operators with our comparison operators. These logical operators are and, or, and not. When using the and operator, both sides of the statement being evaluated must be true for the whole statement to be true. When using the or operator, if either side of the comparison is true, then the whole statement is true. Lastly, the not operator simply inverts the value of the statement immediately following it. So if a statement evaluates to True, and we put the not operator in front of it, it would become False.

# if Statements

We can use the concept of branching to have our code alter its execution sequence depending on the values of variables. We can use an if statement to evaluate a comparison. We start with the if keyword, followed by our comparison. We end the line with a colon. The body of the if statement is then indented to the right. If the comparison is True, the code inside the if body is executed. If the comparison evaluates to False, then the code block is skipped and will not be run.

# else Statements

We just covered the if statement, which executes code if an evaluation is true and skips the code if it’s false. But what if we wanted the code to do something different if the evaluation is false? We can do this using the else statement. The else statement follows an if block, and is composed of the keyword else followed by a colon. The body of the else statement is indented to the right, and will be expected if the above if statement doesn’t execute.

# Modulo Operator

We also touched on the modulo operator, which is represented by the percent sign: %. This operator performs integer division, but only returns the remainder of this division operation. If we’re dividing 5 by 2, the quotient is 2, and the remainder is 1. Two 2s can go into 5, leaving 1 left over. So 5%2 would return 1. Dividing 10 by 5 would give us a quotient of 2 with no remainder, since 5 can go into 10 twice with nothing left over. In this case, 10%2 would return 0, as there is no remainder.

# Conditionals Cheat Sheet

Conditionals Cheat Sheet
In earlier videos, we took a look at some of the built-in Python operators that allow us to compare values, and some logical operators we can use to combine values. We also learned how to use operators in if-else-elif blocks. 

It’s a lot to learn but, with practice, it gets easier to remember it all. In the meantime, this handy cheat sheet gives you all the information you need at a glance. 

Comparison operators

a == b: a is equal to b

a != b: a is different than b

a < b: a is smaller than b

a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b

a > b: a is bigger than b

a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b


Logical operators

a and b: True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.

a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.

not a: True if a is False, False if a is True.
