# Data Type 
In Python, text in between quotes -- either single or double quotes -- is a string data type. An integer is a whole number, without a fraction, while a float is a real number that can contain a fractional part. For example, 1, 7, 342 are all integers, while 5.3, 3.14159 and 6.0 are all floats. When attempting to mix incompatible data types, we may encounter a TypeError. We can always check the data type of something using the type() function.

# Implicit vs Explicit Conversion 
Some data types can be mixed and matched due to implicit conversion. Implicit conversion is where the interpreter helps us out and automatically converts one data type into another, without having to explicitly tell it to do so.

By contrast, explicit conversion is where we manually convert from one data type to another by calling the relevant function for the data type we want to convert to.
