#    Question 4
#    Let's revisit our lucky_number function. We want to change it, so that instead of printing the message, it returns the
#    message. This way, the calling line can print the message, or do something else with it if needed. Fill in the blanks to
#    complete the code to make it work.


def lucky_number(name):
  number = len(name) * 9
  x = "Hello " + name + ". Your lucky number is " + str(number)
  return x
	    
print(lucky_number("Kay"))
print(lucky_number("Cameron"))
