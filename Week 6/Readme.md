# Week 6 

## In this module

We will putting everything we learnt so far into action! We will apply a problem-solving framework to tackle a challenging final project: implementing a script that generates a **"word cloud"** from some text. We will formulate a problem statement to understand the challenge, conduct some research to see what options are available, then begin planning how we intend to solve the problem. Lastly, we will write the code to implement our solution!
